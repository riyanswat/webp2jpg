# WebP to JPG Converter

This is a simple Python script that allows you to convert WebP images to JPG format. The script comes with a graphical user interface (GUI) built using PyQt5, making it easy and intuitive to use.

## Usage
To use the converter, simply run the main.py file. This will launch the GUI, where you can select the WebP file you want to convert and click the "Convert" button to start the conversion process. I also converted the .py file into exe but the file was too big to upload. 

## Requirements
The converter requires Python 3.x and the PyQt5 library. To install the required dependencies, you can use pip:
    ```pip install -r requirements.txt```
    pip install -r requirements.txt
